# Domain Of Interest
**Why are you interested in this field/domain?**
- We found K-Pop to be a good topic because it’s a media data landscape that is rife with layers of racialization and gender. We thought it would be particularly interesting to compare the global data trends of K-Pop, especially being situated in a very Western data context at UW. Finally, we all found a racial connection to the topic; living in the diaspora of Asian-America, understanding the reach of a very much Asian (without American)-based phenomenon in the US produces layers of personal significance and self-reflexivity in understanding and re-articulating the “Asian-ness” that we’ve been dispossessed of.

There is limited information on how the data was collected or generated, meaning that there is a chance we might find another data source instead. We were thinking about including data from Billboard charts instead to find the public radio popularity of K-Pop to complement the music streaming data.
